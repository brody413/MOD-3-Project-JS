Brody McColeman and Jaden Barrick MOD 3 PROJECT
We did the project together as the assignment sheet said we can work in groups of 2

Replacing screen cast with text file

The hardest part for us during this assignment was having to get all our prototypes set up properly and making sure they all were inheritiing everything from the main
function the way they were supposed to be.
Another issue was getting the new cost to print for special rates, which we still couldn't really get working properly even after extensive research on google, we determined
that we are more then likely mising something realy small that we just can't see and thats causing it to not print the way it should.

Something i think we would do differently for next time is looking at having m,ultiple pages for each section, like one html page for regular rentals and then one for special rates
and one for super hosts, and then have buttons that would navigate you through them all.
